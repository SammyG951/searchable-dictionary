# Searchable Dictionary

This is a project I built that utilizes the [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) to allow the user to look up a word and get it's definitions, parts of speech, synonyms, and antonyms. *No CSS applied... to see it with styles see it at my personal site [here]()*

### What I learned

In this project I helped me learn and sharpen my skills with fetching online data with API's, and using DOM to update the web page.


### Purpose for this project

The inspiration for this project came to me when I was searching through a list of free API's. When I noticed this API, I was intriguied by how much data that you can fetch on a certain word. So I wanted to develop a program where a user can search a word and display key information on it.


### Useful resources

- [Public API's](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) - List of free public API's
- [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) - This is the API used for fetching dictionary data.
- [MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - This helped with JavaScript syntax.
